            <h1>Abstract</h1>
            <p style="color: #57559f">
              Mandating interoperability in federal IT by using standards instead of brand names will be critical if the United States Government is to make the most of its public sector procurement power. This is especially true in the context of artificial intelligence and emerging technologies. An analysis of certain IT systems identified as high-risk shows that they have been characterized by vendor lock-in resulting from limited and sole source competitions based on proprietary solutions. This results in a reliance on specific vendors instead of specific technologies.
            </p>
            <p style="color: #57559f">
              Historically, when the U.S. Government has sought innovative solutions, the solicitations referenced standards and where standards did not exist, the solicitations referenced objectives. The resulting solutions have cemented, and in some instances developed into, standards that are credited with massive and significant advances in human history. It is this standards-based approach to procuring new and innovative solutions that needs to be adopted again to ensure the approach to developing and deploying artificial intelligence is rooted in the ideals of openness and innovation through competition.
            </p>
            <p style="color: #57559f">
              This is critical as the velocity of developing emerging technologies will only continue to increase exponentially over the coming years. Advances in quantum computing, electrical power generation, and autonomous vehicles, among other areas of research, are only going to amplify the need to ensure major systems are designed with components that can be replaced as they become obsolete, or in the worst cases, breached or vulnerable. This paper offers recommendations for implementing the concept of mandated interoperability, which range from better solicitation practices, to agency-wide or government-wide policy, and to appropriations language intended to provide relevant agencies with a map to transition to an interoperable IT environment – and to do so today.
            </p>
            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
              “Uniformity in the Currency, Weights and Measures of the United States is an object of great importance.” President George Washington recognized this in his first annual message to Congress, delivered on January 8, 1790. With artificial intelligence (“AI”) promising to change the very way in which we live and prosper, we would do well to remember this statement and ensure it is, as President Washington suggested then, “duly attended to” (<a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/05-04-02-0361" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington, 1970</a>) lest we risk losing our position as “the world’s most robust AI ecosystem” (<a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/news/global-ai-power-rankings-stanford-hai-tool-ranks-36-countries-in-ai" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stanford HAI staff, 2024</a>)
            </p>
            <p>
              The legal foundation is in place to establish sound standards. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (FASA) and the commercial preference it established marked one of the strongest attempts by the U.S. Government to stop using “government-unique specifications and standards” that resulted in the creation of a “longstanding habit of demanding that firms create government-unique versions of goods and services available in the commercial marketplace.” Modern IT has generated open standards that themselves represent the “broad need descriptions that enable vendors to offer a wide variety of commercial solutions” rather than strict specifications that would often result in the procurement of obsolete or unnecessarily unique products and services (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.285536" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Schooner, 2003</a>, 103). This is partly because of the U.S. standardization system, which led to the development of technology that ensures modern IT “is open, market-driven, voluntary, and private-sector-led” (<a href="https://www.ansi.org/standards-news/all-news/2024/09/9-9-24-new-ansi-report-enabling-standards-development-through-public-private-partnerships" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ANSI, 2024</a>, 11).
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, we run the risk of losing the global competition for achieving AI leadership to the People’s Republic of China (“China”), which is are operating under the policy of Eastern Data and Western Computing (<a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/huaweitech/publication/202202/eastern-data-western-computing-network" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jun, 2022</a>), or the European Union (“EU”), which is proceeding under the recommendations provided by Mario Draghi (<a href="https://commission.europa.eu/topics/eu-competitiveness/draghi-report_en" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Draghi, 2024</a>) by launching seven “AI factories” spread across the EU (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_6302" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EuroHPC, 2024</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
              In the United States, as part of an effort to seek information from the public on what should be among the top policy priorities for the Administration’s AI Action Plan, the Office of Science and Technology Policy (“OSTP”) emphasized the importance of removing “burdensome government requirements [that] restrict[] private sector AI development and deployment” (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2025-02305" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NITRD NCO, 2025</a>). Some of those restrictions are self-imposed, such as those associated with procurement (<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2015/m-15-14.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">M-15-14, 2015</a>) or cybersecurity compliance (<a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Policy_Memo.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">M-24-15, 2024</a>). Others are artificial, such as those imposed by vendors via restrictive licensing (<a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-107114" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GAO, 2024</a>). Regardless of the reason, interoperability has been recognized as a key way to cut through these issues from the first national cloud policy (<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/egov_docs/federal-cloud-computing-strategy.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OFCIO, 2011</a>), Executive Order (“EO”) 13800 (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2017-10004" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2017</a>), EO 14144 (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2025-01470" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2025</a>), and EO 14158 (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2025-02005" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2025</a>). As was true in the first Trump Administration and has proven to be true again in the Software Modernization Initiative from EO 14158, “interoperability [is] a top priority for the Federal [G]overnment” and a big part of that is the because of the innovation through competition that it will incentivize (<a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/articles/trump-administrations-plan-put-charge-health-information/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">White House Staff, 2018</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
              In exploring how procurement will play a role in determining whether the move towards an interoperable environment will be a successful effort or not, this paper will cover the following: U.S. Government participation in standards development, the current federal IT landscape, an analysis of select IT procurements, findings worth addressing, and recommendations for implementation. Ultimately, this paper will show that an interoperable cloud is key: mandating that solicitations look to standards and not brand names will ensure that U.S. Government IT systems are set up for the future, have competitiveness built into the system, and encourage and incentivize innovation without compromising security.
            </p>
            <h1>Government Participation in Standards Development</h1>
            <h2>Standardization Generally and Historically</h2>
            <p>
              Even before the Constitution was ratified, our Founding Fathers recognized the U.S. Government’s role in “fixing the standards of weights and measures” was as important as regulating currency – these were among the exclusive powers the Articles of Confederation provided to the U.S. Congress (<a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/uscode1952-001000005" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. Congress, 1952</a>, 942). While the U.S. Government has not shied from setting standards, it has not done so in a consistent manner (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24115664" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lemley, 1999</a>, 746). In fact, between the Revolution and the June 14, 1836 passage of a resolution focused on capacity standards, the effort to create commercial standards had arguably moved forward with sporadic success and, while there was congressional attention, there was little congressional action until the turn of the twentieth century (<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/History_of_Standard_Weights_and_Measures/qEfe8aUaSf8C" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fischer, 1905</a>, 369-71).
            </p>
            <h3>The Foundation</h3>
            <p>
              The year 1900 saw U.S. foreign commerce pass the $1 billion mark and the commercialization of electricity, both critical milestones in the U.S. technological revolution (<a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/MP/nbsmiscellaneouspub275.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cochrane, 1966</a>, 1). When the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) was founded as the National Bureau of Standards (“NBS”) on March 3, 1901, the initial set of standards the agency developed were related to “electricity, length and mass, temperature, light, and time.” In order to effectuate adoption, the NBS also “created a system to transfer those values to the public” via their work and their research (<a href="https://www.nist.gov/timelinelist" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NIST, 2023</a>). Ultimately, the guiding reason for the creation of the NBS was to ensure those aiming to “accomplish together anything useful would be able to understand one another” (<a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/MP/nbsmiscellaneouspub275.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cochrane, 1966</a>, iii).
            </p>
            <h3>Whole-of-Nation Approach</h3>
            <p>
              In 1902, with an eye to benefiting the public and the nation’s economy as a whole, Louis A. Fischer, the Chief of the Division of Weights and Measures from the NBS, “directed scattered inspections of weighing and measuring devices and transactions involving quantities” across New York with a goal of “determin[ing] what amount of protection the buying public was receiving against short weight and short measure in purchase” (<a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nbsspecialpublication447.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Judson, 1976</a>, 20) Taking those findings, the NBS called upon a number of participants from across the country to “discuss the lack of uniform standards,” resulting in what turned out to be the first meeting of the National Conference on Weights and Measures (<a href="https://www.ncwm.com/history" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NCWM, 2025</a>). As the mission of the NBS both expanded and showed dividends, it led to then-Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover championing “standardization as a method for preventing ‘waste in industry’” shortly after World War I (<a href="https://arussell.org/papers/futuregeneration-russell.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russell, 2005</a>, 263).
            </p>
            <h3>Modern Computing</h3>
            <p>
              The focus of the NBS on standardization and the research necessary to develop those standards produced real results, including the first proximity fuze, introduced in 1941, and “credited by some with shortening the course of World War II” (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/21014" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haseltine, 1953</a>, 299). NBS wasn’t alone in creating real advances in computing based on a pursuit of standardized approaches to training – the electronic numerical integrator and computer, or ENIAC, is considered the first general purpose computer (<a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/worlds-first-general-purpose-computer-turns-75" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brockmeier, 2021</a>). The U.S. Army Ordnance Department purchased the ENIAC after a proposal submitted by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert dated June 5, 1943 (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/45363261" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Weik, 1961</a>, 571). This assistive tool in calculating artillery firing tables provided two important developments: (1) a procurement that focused on outcomes while proposing techniques to achieve them such as the example outlined in 1(b) on Vacuum Tube Trigger Circuit with the ENIAC team’s proposed way out of the three, then-known “ways of obtaining a circuit action similar to that of a thyratron;” and (2) the use of certain standards when necessary, such as manufacturer’s data for the 6J6 vacuum tubes that outlines the plate voltage, amplification factor, transconductance, and other metrics the system will meet (<a href="https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Knuth_Don_X4100/PDF_index/k-8-pdf/k-8-u2614-2-Units-Composing-Analyzer.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Knuth, 1942</a>).
            </p>
            <h2>Standardization in IT Specifically</h2>
            <p>
              The importance of standards to IT, like those developed by ENIAC and beyond, “is difficult to overstate” especially as it relates to modern, complex, and “sophisticated digital systems and devices” (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2023.104830" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blind et al., 2023</a>, 2). In particular, standards developed via public research in a fashion that makes them available to anyone “provides the opportunity for the implementation of research results … in innovative technologies, products, and services.” Open standards developed for and through public procurement have been shown to “create critical masses and [to] allow the exploitation of economies of scale in the emerging phases of a new market” with notable examples including “[s]uccessful platforms such as the Internet and the cellular telephone” (<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Handbook_of_Innovation_and_Standards/AXkvDwAAQBAJ" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hawkins et al., 2017</a>, 48, 53).
            </p>
            <h3>Publicly-Funded Research</h3>
            <p>
              The first working transistor, demonstrated at Bell Laboratories on December 23, 1947 by William Shockley, John Bardeen, and Walter Brattain, was the result of war-time work to improve radar that started with a research grant awarded to the University of Purdue from the Office of Scientific Research and Development in March 1942 (<a href="https://www.physics.purdue.edu/about/history/semi_conductor_research.html" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bray, 2016</a>). From then onwards, the microelectronics industry in particular benefited from the U.S. Government’s “direct and indirect procurement policies” by allowing an otherwise “price-insensitive market” to lower prices as members of industry improved and innovated their approaches. While most “analysts credit the existence of the potential public sector market with inducing private investment in [research and development (“R\&amp;D”)],” others point out that innovation could have been primarily due to the involvement of government agencies “as information clearinghouses” that resulted in the “disseminating [of] diverse approaches” instead (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23703131" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Holbrook, 1995</a>, 134-35). Regardless of the reason, the sector benefited from the promise of a buyer the size of the U.S. Government would create the necessary demand to create new technologies (<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/VRz9LfC85pYC" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lécuyer, 2006</a>, 130).
            </p>
            <h3>Digital Revolution</h3>
            <p>
              Advances in research were not limited to those taking place outside of the Federal Government – in May 1950, NBS deployed the Standards Electronic Automatic Computer, or SEAC, which served as the first stored-program computer built by the U.S. Government and improved the reliability of components and the ability to optimize the storage of data (<a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/sp958-lide/086-089.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kirsch, 2001</a>, 86). Funded by the U.S. Air Force, experiments run on SEAC are “still cited as a model of how computational experiments should be made and reported” (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/41579.41582" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Todd, 1987</a>, 50). In fact, many of the decisions made in developing SEAC are relevant today, including the use of square binary pixels (<a href="https://tsapps.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=821701" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kirsch, 1998</a>, 10).
            </p>
            <h3>Personal Computing</h3>
            <p>
              ERA 1101, later called the UNIVAC 1101, was the first stored-program computer that, unlike SEAC, could be transferred from the site of manufacture to the site of deployment and could be run at an “unheard-of performance level for the time” via advances such as its own air conditioning, built-in marginal checking for maintenance, and fault isolation through a centralized maintenance panel (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/MAHC.1979.10015" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tomash &amp; Cohen, 1979</a>, 90). The very first customer was the U.S. Navy, which took delivery in the late 1950s (<a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/AD0694600" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ONR, 1951</a>). This advance allowed for a scalable commercialization of computers and ultimately the personal computer itself (<a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/brochures/doc-437295703f6f2/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ERA, 1951</a>) after a great deal of systematic learning and R\&amp;D funded through those Navy contracts (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23703182" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Norberg, 1993</a>, 192).
            </p>
            <h3>The Information Revolution</h3>
            <p>
              On December 9, 1968, Douglas Engelbart gave the “Mother of all Demos,” a demonstration of technology that he developed with his colleagues at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) that was funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (“ARPA”) and the Air Force (<a href="https://www.darpa.mil/about/innovation-timeline" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DARPA, 2025</a>). The demonstration included innovations collectively called the oN-Line System (NLS) and it introduced features that were focused on improving the capabilities of the user (i.e., “augment intellectual capability”) rather than on making the system easier to use (<a href="https://dougengelbart.org/content/view/209/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doug Engelbart Institute, 2023</a>). Among those innovations, many of them such as the computer mouse, document version control, and email not only exist today but were provided to users at scale via ARPANET, which itself was the result of a 1968 contract to BBN Technologies for the very first routers and developed using the same principles behind the development of NLS. Arguably, much of the internet itself is feasible only because of DARPA’s advances in wireless communications, among other things (<a href="https://www.darpa.mil/about/innovation-timeline" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DARPA, 2025</a>). From that point on, federal research funding for computer science, electrical engineering, and other related fields has played a critical role in advancing work in computer architecture, artificial intelligence, and other direct contributions to today’s technology, accounting for “roughly 70 percent of total university research funding in computer science and electrical engineering since 1976” (<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Funding_a_Revolution/XuhuAgAAQBAJ" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Committee on Innovations in Computing and Communications: Lessons from History et al., 1999</a>, 56). That trend has only become stronger over time, going from $20.8 billion in 2025 dollars obligated for R\&amp;D in 1976 to an estimated $195.7 billion in 2024 (<a href="https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf25329" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NCSES, 2025</a>).
            </p>
            <h1>The Current Federal IT Landscape</h1>
            <p>
              In much the same way university-funded research is heavily reliant on U.S. Government funding, much of the tech industry is reliant on open source technologies (<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/17/1077498/future-open-source/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ackermann, 2023</a>). The ability to develop open standards is relatively natural – where standards do not exist and where industry is reluctant to coalesce around one or a set of standards, encouragement from the public sector has been shown to work (<a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/the-impact-of-standardization-and-standards-on-innovation/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blind, 2013</a>, 26). However, for a variety of reasons, that forcing-function sometimes needs a catalyst of its own. As such, it is important to understand how and why the U.S. Government has ended up with an IT environment built on brand-names instead of standards and what it may mean to use policy levers based on competition, policy, and cybersecurity considerations to effectuate the sought after move towards interoperability to support AI and other technologies.
            </p>
            <h2>Competition Considerations</h2>
            <p>
              The current era of technology is marked by a significant transition, driven by the public availability of Generative AI (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsWtiop4IJA&t=443s" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Huang, 2023</a>). The amount of computational power necessary to run AI solutions arguably means the foundations of modern IT began with the advent of cloud computing as the most significant AI-related developments were only feasible due to the availability of massive cloud-based computing infrastructure  (<a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2402.08797" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sastry et al., 2024</a>). The 17 “Major IT Investments Rated as High Risk for Four Consecutive Quarters” as identified by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) in a recent report to Congress are the types of systems that would benefit from such modernization not only because of the amount and type of data they process, store, and transmit to the public or other agencies, but also because of the scale, cost, and complexity associated with these systems (<a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-107041" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GAO, 2024</a>, 56). In fact, some of these systems operate the workflows or possess data from the earliest days of the U.S. Government’s use of computing, attributable to “a rapid decrease in costs [and] real competition among vendors” (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/174690.174693" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Johnson et al., 1993</a>, 18).

              Promoting competition requires a focus on meaningful competition rather than formalistic competition (<a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=4372044" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Schooner &amp; Berteau, 2023</a>) and the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 (“CICA”) (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/98th-congress/house-bill/5184" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1984</a>) (became law as part of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/98th-congress/house-bill/4170" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1984</a>)), while noble in its intent, has seemingly not been enough on its own. An example of what CICA partly aimed to achieve can be shown in the procurement of typewriters: a procurement team could have chosen to go with the IBM Selectric II but instead decided to focus on the salient characteristic that made it so superior: the typeball (<a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=3706866" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Schooner, 2020</a>, 146). A more modern example for demonstrating what it could achieve, can be shown in the procurement of software for PDF files: a procurement team could choose to go with Adobe Acrobat or instead focus on the salient characteristic of software that can handle ISO 32000-based PDF files (<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/51502.html" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ISO, 2008</a>). A search of USASpending.gov covering FY 2008 to FY 2025 shows 2,300+ contracts for “Adobe Acrobat,” accounting for more than $237 million in spending (<a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=c9fbad11ed241760e100c0acb3fcef36" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GSA, 2025</a>). There are zero contracts involving “ISO 32000” (<a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=36db9c46e68f9f7a1b27a6bc4c013b23" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GSA, 2025</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
              The Federal Procurement Data System shows very similar results, with nearly 3,500 matches for the brand name and none for the standard (<a href="https://www.fpds.gov/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GSA, 2025</a>). As it relates to cloud-based technology, while not dispositive, there are five contracts that reference “ISO 27001” meaning that at least the Department of State (“DOS”), Department of Treasury (“Treasury”), and Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) have explored the idea of citing standards instead of brand names (<a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=086d98de8bb8de9114ea647568b713c2" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GSA, 2025</a>). While seemingly limited in nature, the use of this open standard, in fact, generates far more robust competition than simply naming a provider or program. It allows for the agencies to “support multiple products that operate on multiple platforms” with that competition able to help the U.S. Government “open the enterprise” not simply the environment itself (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/174690.174693" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Johnson et al., 1993</a>, 19). This is important to note because it signifies the potential for broadening the pool of potential vendors, a critical factor identified as being necessary to increase meaningful and impactful competition in public procurement (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdab051" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kang &amp; Miller, 2021</a>, 1495). Data collected over several years in Finland (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.4485" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pitkänen, 2022</a>), Slovenia (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1787/c1e5d31f-en" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OECD, 2025</a>), the United Kingdom (<a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/insights/competition-in-public-procurement-lessons-learned/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NAO, 2023</a>), and the United States (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/01900692.2019.1666408" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atkinson, 2019</a>) shows a larger vendor pool can drive competition as well as exposure to a greater number of market-driven solutions simply by virtue of the diversity of options.

            <h2>Policy Considerations</h2>
            <p>
              Obtaining those benefits requires a modern policy foundation as well. Within IT procurement, there are a number of specific issue areas that are not only significant in procurement generally, but are particularly impactful on the idea of using interoperability to increase the total number of participants in public sector procurements. These include: prioritizing commercially-available solutions over government-specific ones, supporting modern pricing models, addressing legal restrictions associated with switching solutions, and ensuring data can move across systems seamlessly.
            </p>
            <h3>COTS over GOTS</h3>
            <p>
              Palantir USG, Inc. v. United States, No. 2017-1465 (Fed. Cir. Sept. 13, 2018) (<a href="https://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions-orders/palantir_17-1465.opinion.9-13-18.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Palantir USG v. U.S., 2018</a>) provides an important data point in the discussion around whether those solutions should be commercially available (commercial-off-the- shelf solutions, or COTS) or custom-made (government-off-the-shelf, or GOTS) (<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3276365" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Schooner, 2018</a>). With Palantir as well as Executive Order 14271 (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2025-06835" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2025</a>) establishing a COTS-first procurement policy, this could result in the exposure of government IT systems to components not yet reviewed or otherwise exposed to the unique stresses of government IT – for example, in 2024, there were “approximately 9,100 software-as-a- service (SaaS) companies in the United States” (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1239046/top-saas-countries-list/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vailshery, 2024</a>) but only 384 total cloud services (software, platforms, and infrastructure) were both approved and on the FedRAMP Marketplace before the program began a major rework (<a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FedRAMP PMO, 2025</a>). This presents issues associated with shadow IT and also limits the choices, keeping staff from using solutions that represent better return on investment, greater functionality, or new technologies (<a href="https://netchoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/NetChoice_Garland_The-Pernicious-Consequences-of-Vendor-Lock.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garland, 2023</a>, 2).
            </p>
            <h3>Consumption-Based Pricing</h3>
            <p>
              Much of the tech industry delivers and prices cloud services on a consumption basis, meaning that users incur “charges on a predetermined periodic basis … and [are] billed based on actual usage” (<a href="https://www.gsa.gov/system/files/MV-21-06%20with%20sup%201_0.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AL MV-21-06, 2022</a>, 2-3). To access many of these services often requires an upfront payment to allow for consumption to begin, meaning policies that allow for these advanced payments without violating the Anti-Deficiency Act had to be developed by establishing certain criteria that, when met, would provide for the specific authorization necessary to make such a purchase (<a href="https://www.gsa.gov/system/files/MV-2024-01.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AL MV-2024-01, 2024</a>). While the color of money and budgeting issues will remain, once that funding is available, the ability to pay for commercial services using commercial methods will incentivize greater participation in the contractor ecosystem and the impending Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”) rewrite could be a major step towards addressing this issue (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2025-06839" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exec. Order No. 14275, 2025</a>).
            </p>
            <h3>Impacts of Restrictive Licensing</h3>
            <p>
              The use of restrictive licensing terms to stifle competition is well documented but arguably not well enough known as they are allowed to continue in public sector contracts (<a href="https://netchoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/NetChoice_Garland_The-Pernicious-Consequences-of-Vendor-Lock.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garland, 2023</a>, 2). Beyond leaving government agencies unable to achieve accurate data around usage (<a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-105717" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GAO, 2024</a>), these restrictive licenses have left agencies paying more while limiting their ability to use the best and latest tools (<a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-107114" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GAO, 2024</a>). Specifically, as the United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority found, one tech provider charged public and private sector customers who attempted to use their services or software alongside components from “its main rivals” higher prices, sometimes 400% “higher than the retail price it charges its own customers,” which made it economically unviable to continue down the path of creating a multi-cloud environment or to outright switch to another vendor (<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/67989251419bdbc8514fdee4/summary_of_provisional_decision.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CMA, 2025</a>, 5). With a Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) antitrust probe looking into the impact of that same vendor’s licensing practices on the public and private sectors of the United States, the legal mechanisms that stifle interoperability could become quantifiable in the context of the Federal Government’s spending (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/trumps-ftc-moves-ahead-with-broad-antitrust-probe-microsoft-bloomberg-news-2025-03-12/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Satija et al., 2025</a>). Running in parallel to the FTC investigation, the Strengthening Agency Management and Oversight of Software Assets (“SAMOSA”) Act is intended to create a federal software and cloud services license inventory, allowing every agency to determine the quantifiable impact of restrictive licensing agreements (among other factors, including artificial technical barriers to interoperability) and the associated cost for the Federal Government (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/2417" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAMOSA Act, 2025</a>). Addressing licensing issues in public sector procurement could finally allow the U.S. Government to achieve the “significant savings” GAO recognized would be possible over a decade ago (<a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-14-413" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GAO, 2014</a>).
            </p>
            <h3>Data Portability and Machine Readability</h3>
            <p>
              Just like telephone number portability before it, data portability represents the ability of the U.S. Government to move its data from one Cloud Service Provider (“CSP”) to another (<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/data-portability-and-interoperability-a-primer-on-two-policy-tools-for-regulation-of-digitized-industries-2/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gulati-Gilbert &amp; Seamans, 2023</a>). While important for allowing a government agency to move to a better or cheaper rival, it is also important to better effectuate the use of AI solutions to generate insights from the variety of different data silos that exist across governments, industry, and academia (<a href="https://impact.economist.com/projects/building-the-future-of-digital-assets/en/article/whitepaper/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sena et al., 2023</a>). As a corollary, besides being required by the OPEN Government Data Act (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1770" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2017</a>) (became law as part of the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4174" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019</a>)), making data machine-readable where and whenever feasible will allow for an easier transition to new, different, and better solutions that make use of existing data, something GAO has been advocating for since as early as April 11, 1983 (<a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/ggd-83-39" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GAO, 1983</a>).
            </p>
            <h2>Cybersecurity Considerations</h2>
            <p>
              Where interoperability accommodates for swapping vendors from the perspective of competition, it also allows for the same from the perspective of a technology stack. The technical benefits of interoperability are relatively practical in nature: where a component is compromised, it can be swapped out; where hardening of the IT infrastructure is required, zero trust architecture can be supported; and, where software and hardware are connected, it can provide for more effective data transfer capabilities, among other benefits.
            </p>
            <h3>Removing Bad Actors</h3>
            <p>
              The U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission cited data standardization and interoperability as critical components for obtaining “improved combined situational awareness of cyber threats” and allowing “for the sharing and fusing of threat information, insight, and other relevant data across the Federal Government and between the public and private sectors” (<a href="https://www.solarium.gov/report" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSC, 2020</a>, 101-02). The importance of interoperability was most apparent on September 13, 2017, when the U.S. Government issued a mandate to remove all “Kaspersky-branded Products” from Federal Government IT infrastructure (<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/bod-17-01-removal-kaspersky-branded-products" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BOD 17-01, 2017</a>) and from the United States entirely on June 20, 2024 (<a href="https://www.bis.gov/press-release/commerce-department-prohibits-russian-kaspersky-software-u.s.-customers" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BIS, 2024</a>). After Israeli intelligence discovered Russian intelligence used a backdoor in Kaspersky’s antivirus software “as a kind of worldwide search engine” to look for data containing the codenames of American intelligence programs (<a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/kaspersky-finally-evicted-from-the-us" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uren, 2024</a>), the U.S. Government required all agencies to rip and replace the software from their IT infrastructure, regardless of the cost. From a hardware perspective, and on a national scale, we saw something similar with the Secure and Trusted Communications Network Reimbursement Program aimed at removing communications equipment and services produced or provided by Huawei or ZTE (<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/supplychain/reimbursement" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FCC, 2025</a>) with funding approvals sent on July 18, 2022 (<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/supply-chain-reimbursement-program-updated-faqs-user-guide-issued" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DA-24-839, 2024</a>) and deadlines for removal “ranging from May 29, 2024 to February 4, 2025” (<a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-402312A1.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rosenworcel, 2024</a>). A Congressional investigation into the risks associated with Chinese intelligence using the vulnerabilities found in the hardware from these companies discovered there is no feasible way to be confident that such intrusions can be blocked or otherwise stopped (<a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=327" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike &amp; Ruppersberger, 2012</a>). With that finding, the U.S. Government estimates it will have to spend “nearly $5 billion” to free American telecommunications networks from the proprietary hardware provided by those two vendors (<a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-408316A1.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FCC, 2024</a>). Both instances are useful examples of the need for “best practices for providing interoperability between free and open” systems (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1365/s43439-024-00112-6" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bu, 2024</a>, 296), both technically and programmatically (i.e., through governance), including via the procurement process, as they demonstrate the extreme cost and significant non-financial impacts that vendor lock-in can cause.
            </p>
            <h3>Improving Internal Systems</h3>
            <p>
              The Secure by Design initiative (<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CISA, 2025</a>) and the recommendations provided by the Cyber Safety Review Board report on the Microsoft Online Exchange Incident from 2023 (<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/CSRB-Review-Summer-2023-MEO-Intrusion" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSRB, 2024</a>) are among the ways the U.S. Government is reacting to cybersecurity weaknesses exploited by China, Russia, Iran, and others (<a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-issues-comprehensive-proposed-rule-addressing-national-security-risks" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DOJ, 2024</a>). The Department of Defense (“DoD”), in particular, issued updated guidance on software acquisition, requiring the adoption of the Software Acquisition Pathway (“SWP”) (<a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/4114775/modern-software-acquisition-to-speed-delivery-boost-warfighter-lethality/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DOD, 2025</a>) and focusing on security as non-negotiable. However, the guidance still recognizes the need for “nontraditional and commercial software developers” to join the Defense Industrial Base (“DIB”) and add the kind of increased supplier base that results in increased competition and allows for delivering advantages to the warfighter and nation as a whole (<a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/4114775/modern-software-acquisition-to-speed-delivery-boost-warfighter-lethality/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lopez &amp; Shinego, 2025</a>). As the SWP outlines on numerous occasions, a DoD component’s interoperability strategy and requirements are among the top responsibilities outlined in the SWP (<a href="https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/500087p.PDF" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DoDI 5000.87, 2020</a>, 5-7, 9, 14, 21). This is especially critical for zero-trust architecture (“ZTA”) and other cybersecurity-related efforts considering GAO and the U.S. Government recognize “there is no single ZTA solution [and] ZTA implementation requires integrating existing technologies with each other and with newer technologies” (<a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-106065" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GAO, 2022</a>, 2). Fundamentally, zero trust is “a collection of concepts and ideas designed to minimize uncertainty in enforcing” access related policies, and not a product or technology you can simply plug into a system – it is the actual policies and underlying choices behind the design of the system architecture, or “the network infrastructure (physical and virtual)” (<a href="https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-207" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NIST SP 800-207, 2020</a>, 4).
            </p>
            <h3>Remembering Hardware</h3>
            <p>
              The CHIPS and Science Act (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4346" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2022</a>) and related efforts helped fund “domestically-located semiconductor fab[ricator]s [which have been recognized] as a requirement to maintain the nation’s leadership in AI” with a heavy focus on interoperability throughout the legislation, including a $1.5 billion Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47523" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blevins et al., 2023</a>). The National Strategy on Microelectronics Research went further, citing the efforts of the U.S. Government’s preferences to develop semiconductor technology as part of why U.S. students were able to create “ENIAC on a chip” (<a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/National-Strategy-on-Microelectronics-Research-March-2024.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SML &amp; NSTC, 2024</a>). In developing the standards for these critical hardware components, the Federal Government recognized “[i]nteroperability across systems and devices” is vital and they need to provide “[e]fficient and effective acquisition processes” to make this work (<a href="https://www.nist.gov/publications/semiconductors-and-microelectronics-standards-report-semiconductors-and" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NIST IR 8501, 2023</a>, 2).
            </p>
            <h1>An Analysis of Select IT Procurements</h1>
            <p>
              The maps in Appendix B were created using the 17 high-risk systems identified by GAO and by reviewing their Privacy Impact Assessments (“PIA”). The maps demonstrate the number of systems connected to the high-risk system, the agencies and organizations reliant on the high-risk system, and, where applicable, the individuals who are ultimately impacted by the safety, security, and stability of any of the systems intrinsically connected to the high-risk system. Where publicly available, the awards made to develop, deploy, operate, and maintain those systems of those systems, were then analyzed, allowing at least a high-level overview into whether the underlying procurements promoted interoperability via standards-based approaches or if they incentivized vendor lock-in by limiting competition, through a variety of means, to only solutions provided by or serviced by specific vendors.
            </p>
            <h2>Department of Homeland Security</h2>
            <h3>Biometric Exit Mobile Program</h3>
            <p>
              The Biometric Exit Mobile Program (“BEMP”) involves six systems maintained by components within U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) with the purpose being “to capture biometric and biographic information in support of [the DHS] border security mission” with every American who enters or exits the United States likely to come across this system (<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/publication/biometric-exit-mobile-air-test" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DHS/CBP/PIA-026, 2018</a>). Within the PIAs, one industry solution is referenced by type. Among the relevant awards, two brand names were mentioned with no standards mentioned. The ultimate end users are the members of the American public who will not connect to the system but will have their data stored and used within the BEMP. Were the BEMP to enforce interoperability, the American public, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, and the DHS as a whole would likely benefit if only because this system is so interconnected with other critical systems within the DHS ecosystem. Additionally, if interoperability became the standard, the DHS Office of Biometric and Identity Management would eventually be converted to support such an approach by virtue of those connections (<a href="https://kumu.io/oghaffari/high-risk-it-investments#dhs-biometric-exit-mobile-program" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghaffari-Tabrizi, 2025</a>), resulting in any biometric system used within the DHS mission likely to benefit as well.
            </p>
            <h3>Financial Management Systems</h3>
            <p>
              The Financial Management Systems (“FMS”) are 12 systems maintained by components within DHS that perform the “core financial management functions” for the entirety of the department (<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhsallpia-053-dhs-financial-management-systems" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DHS/ALL/PIA-053, 2020</a>). There are additional connections to other agencies to execute on this function – the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”), Treasury, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), General Services Administration (“GSA”), and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”). Within the PIAs, two industry solutions are referenced by name. Among the relevant awards, three brand names are referenced six times, including via a limited sources justification, with no standards mentioned. The ultimate end user is DHS staff who will have to both connect to and rely on these various systems. While that means everyone at DHS must engage with this system in some fashion, whether that is as an actual user or to have their data included among these systems, interoperability via FMS would be particularly impactful because of those connected. Anything involving finances tends to have the ability to influence everything else within an agency because financial data is so critical to their operations (e.g., payroll, contract awards, grants, etc.) and where those systems go, others tend to follow, and in this case, it would be broad swathes of inter-connected agencies (<a href="https://kumu.io/oghaffari/high-risk-it-investments#dhs-financial-management-systems" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghaffari-Tabrizi, 2025</a>).
            </p>
            <h3>Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology System</h3>
            <p>
              The Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology System (“HART”) is a modernization effort intended to replace the Automated Biometric Identification System (“IDENT”), a “system for storage and processing of biometric and associated biographic information” collected and maintained by multiple components across DHS (<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhsobimpia-004-homeland-advanced-recognition-technology-system-hart-increment-1" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DHS/OBIM/PIA-004, 2024</a>). There are no industry solutions referenced by name in the PIAs. Among the relevant awards, one brand name is referenced with no standards mentioned. The ultimate end users are DHS, DOS, DoD, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (“OPM”), the Intelligence Community, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) as well as state and international law enforcement partners. The importance of this system, beyond its centralized and consolidated role involving biometric data of every American and visitor to the United States, is the connections it has to other agencies within the Federal Government, State and Local governments, and international law enforcement agencies. Beyond the opportunity to influence and create harmonization between American public sector organizations, the ability to influence those overseas provides real strength to the argument that American-made solutions are market-leading ones (<a href="https://kumu.io/oghaffari/high-risk-it-investments#dhs-homeland-adv-recognition-technology-system" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghaffari-Tabrizi, 2025</a>). It also should allow for the entirety of the global public and private sector that believes in and agrees with the ideals such standards would promote to have a real opportunity to coalesce around and support such an approach towards developing technology without having to compromise or give up their own history or culture (<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/lVrF2lUnalwC" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Morishima, 1982</a>).

            <p>
              The Single Family Housing Enterprise Data Warehouse (“SFHEDW”) is a collection of 13 systems maintained by the Single Family Housing Programs within the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”), serving “as a consolidated source of single-family mortgage and insuring data” <a href="https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/OCHCO/documents/11-D64A-SFHEDW-PIA-Extract.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(HUD D64A SFHEDW PIA, 2020</a>). Within the PIAs, one industry solution is referenced by name. Among the relevant awards, five brand names are referenced, including via limited source justifications, with no standards mentioned. The ultimate end users are HUD, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Federal Reserve Banks. Regardless of how HUD’s mission changes, the interconnected nature of the SFHEDW and its responsibility to store and provide for use any and all single family housing-related data within HUD means the ability to influence other systems is broad by default (<a href="https://kumu.io/oghaffari/high-risk-it-investments#hud-single-family-housing-ent-data-warehouse" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghaffari-Tabrizi, 2025</a>). The current reliance on a single vendor, unfortunately, does not incentivize the other system owners, the Federal Reserve Banks, or other users to change their architecture to be anything other than proprietary as nothing indicates the vendor or the SFHEDW system owner is pushing in that direction.

            <h2>Department of Interior</h2>
            <h3>Accounting Reconciliation Tool</h3>
            <p>
              The Accounting Reconciliation Tool (“ART”) is one system maintained by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (“BIA”) within the Department of Interior (“DOI”) and the DOJ, serving as a method “to query transactions from legacy data sources” (<a href="https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/uploads/ost_art_pia_final_09.01.2017.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DOI OST-ART PIA, 2017</a>). Within the PIAs, there are no industry solutions referenced. Among the relevant awards, there are no brand names or standards referenced. The ultimate end users are involved with Tribal nations that have trust accounts with BIA. While there is only a single system, the fact that every single Tribal nation is reliant on this for critical financial functions and the necessity for the data and actions taking place on the system to be used, at times, by DOJ attorneys who need to be able to rely on it for evidence, gives this solitary system a significant degree of potential impact (<a href="https://kumu.io/oghaffari/high-risk-it-investments#doi-accounting-reconciliation-tool" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghaffari-Tabrizi, 2025</a>). In fact, for some Tribal nations, the operations of this system can be a necessity for survival as it disburses nearly $1 billion annually and has $9 billion under active management on any day (<a href="https://www.doi.gov/ost" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DOI, 2025</a>), meaning the system owners have major leverage.

            <h3>Incident Management Analysis and Reporting System</h3>
            <p>
              The Incident Management Analysis and Reporting System (“IMARS”) is one system maintained by the Office of Law Enforcement and Security (“OLES”) within DOI (<a href="https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/imars-pia-03122022-1.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DOI IMARS PIA, 2022</a>), which should be a COTS product that is intended to serve as “an enterprise-wide incident management and reporting” system. Within the PIAs, there are no industry solutions referenced. Among the relevant awards, there are two brand names mentioned. Among the relevant awards, there are two brand names of service providers mentioned and no standards referenced. The ultimate end users are law enforcement agencies across the country. While IMARS is a single system run by a single office, it reaches every law enforcement agency at any level that has to interact with DOI’s OLES team (<a href="https://kumu.io/oghaffari/high-risk-it-investments#doi-incident-mgt-analysis-and-reporting-system" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghaffari-Tabrizi, 2025</a>). This reach means all levels of law enforcement could be pushed to adopt some level of interoperability within their infrastructure if only because of the ability of IMARS to support them should they make such a switch but there is currently no incentive for those named providers to make any change.
            </p>
            <h3>Law Enforcement Management Information System</h3>
            <p>
              The Law Enforcement Management Information System (“LEMIS”) is one system maintained by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service within DOI “to help carry out operations and enforcement actions” (<a href="https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/pia-lemis-final.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DOI LEMIS PIA, 2020</a>). Within the PIA, there are no industry solutions referenced. Among the relevant awards, like IMARS, there are no brand names or standards referenced. The ultimate end users are segments of the U.S. public who are involved with or obtain data on incidents in national lands. Much like IMARS, this is a single system with a broad reach – while IMARS focused on providing information to law enforcement, LEMIS provides the American public an opportunity to manage and review their cases and other publicly available information via the system (<a href="https://kumu.io/oghaffari/high-risk-it-investments#doi-law-enforcement-management-info-system" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghaffari-Tabrizi, 2025</a>). With this system, the vast number of combinations available due to public accessibility makes interoperability a two-way benefit – it will provide users a seamless experience regardless of their particular tech stack and system owners the ability to keep this widely-used system modernized over time.

            <h3>Trust Asset and Accounting Management System</h3>
            <p>
              The Trust Asset and Accounting Management System (“TAAMS”) are four systems maintained by components within BIA and DOI that serve as an “integrated land management system” for “48.7 million acres of tribally owned land, 6 million acres of Federally-owned land, and approximately 181,000 acres of Federally-owned land held in Trust status” (<a href="https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/taams-pia-09292021.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DOI TAAMS PIA, 2021</a>). Within the PIAs, there is one industry solution referenced. Among the relevant awards, there are two brand names and no standards referenced. The ultimate end users are Tribal nations who obtain funding and other financial services from the U.S. Government (<a href="https://kumu.io/oghaffari/high-risk-it-investments#doi-trust-asset-and-acct-mgt-system" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghaffari-Tabrizi, 2025</a>). Of note is that many Tribal nations view data sovereignty as part of their Tribal sovereignty (<a href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2024/a-new-era-for-indigenous-data-sovereignty" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mohr, 2024</a>), and as experiences in setting up a data sharing agreement with the EU has shown, especially where those sovereignty priorities align, dealing with the technical impact of such circumstances is not trivial (<a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=4585431" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barczentewicz, 2023</a>). Interoperability, where feasible, can address some of these concerns as data portability is ultimately a benefit of an interoperable system, and the ability to move data from one system to another is critical in a data sovereignty scenario (<a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/data_portability_and_interoperability_jan23.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Cloud, 2023</a>).

              The Unemployment Insurance Reporting System (“UIRS”) is one system maintained by the U.S. Department of Labor (“DOL”) with the intention of moving data currently on “physical servers … to the cloud [in order to] enhance data validation at the point of input to avoid errors” (<a href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/general/privacy/UIRS_PIA.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DOL UIRS PIA, 2024</a>). Within the PIAs, there is one industry solution referenced. Among the relevant awards, there are no brand names or standards referenced. The ultimate end users are segments of the American public who obtain unemployment insurance and the state governments who manage relevant programs (<a href="https://kumu.io/oghaffari/high-risk-it-investments#dol-unemployment-insurance-rept-system" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghaffari-Tabrizi, 2025</a>). This is especially important as this system’s ability to fully adopt interoperability will mean the state and local governments that connect to it will also benefit from the change and potentially be influenced by it as well if only because they’ll witness the improvements first-hand.

              The Global Foreign Affairs Compensation System (“GFACS”) is one system maintained by DOS and designed as the “global pay system” for the salaries and compensation of every single DOS employee (<a href="https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Global-Foreign-Affairs-Compensation-System-GFACS-PIA.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DOS 5441 GFACS PIA, 2022</a>). Within the PIAs, there are no industry solutions referenced. Among the relevant awards, there is one brand name and no standards referenced. The ultimate end users are DOS staff who use or otherwise rely on GFACS to get paid. While the influence of this system seems limited by virtue of the sparse inter-connections represented via the PIA (<a href="https://kumu.io/oghaffari/high-risk-it-investments#dos-global-foreign-affairs-comp-system" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghaffari-Tabrizi, 2025</a>), the fact it touches every DOS employee means it is required to interact with staff in our Embassies and Consulates, potentially spreading the influence from DOS to the contractors and other government agencies overseas that interact with those facilities.

            <h3>Retirement Benefits Services</h3>
            <p>
              The Retirement Benefits Services (“RBS”) is a collection of 13 systems maintained by OPM and DOI, Social Security Administration (“SSA”), Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (“CMS”) within HHS, and the Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs within DOL, reliant mainly on seven core systems, which include the: (1) Acceptance of Scanned Retirement Documents Project (<a href="https://www.opm.gov/information-management/privacy-policy/privacy-policy/acceptance-of-scanned-retirement-documents-project-pia.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2020</a>); (2) Annuity Roll System (<a href="https://www.opm.gov/information-management/privacy-policy/privacy-policy/ars.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2021</a>); (3) CXone Retirement Services Contact Center as a Service (<a href="https://www.opm.gov/information-management/privacy-policy/privacy-policy/CXOne-RS-CCaaS-PIA.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2021</a>); (4) Federal Annuity Claims Export System (FACES) (<a href="https://www.opm.gov/information-management/privacy-policy/privacy-policy/faces.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2020</a>); (5) Interim Closeout Data Capture (ICDC) (<a href="https://www.opm.gov/information-management/privacy-policy/privacy-policy/icdc-pia.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019</a>); (6) Online Retirement Application (ORA) (Pilot) (<a href="https://www.opm.gov/information-management/privacy-policy/privacy-policy/ora-pia.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2022</a>); and, (7) Services Online (SOL) (<a href="https://www.opm.gov/information-management/privacy-policy/privacy-policy/pia_sol.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2021</a>). Within the PIAs, three industry solutions are referenced with two by name. Among the relevant awards, five brand names are referenced six times, including via limited source justifications, with no standards mentioned. The ultimate end users are Federal staff and employees who rely on the systems to process retirement benefits. While many of the systems reviewed have great potential, the RBS is particularly important due to the fact that every agency’s human resources department, every employee, and key agencies like DOI, SSA, HHS, and DOL (<a href="https://kumu.io/oghaffari/high-risk-it-investments#opm-retirement-benefits-services" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghaffari-Tabrizi, 2025</a>) would benefit from and be influenced by a shift to interoperability because of the interconnected nature of these systems and the criticality of the data they contain.

              This system allows users “to retrieve, review, and update payroll information” (<a href="https://media.defense.gov/2024/Jan/19/2003378857/-1/-1/0/MYPAY.PDF" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DD 2930, 2023</a>) and is primarily run for the Defense Finance Accounting Service (“DFAS”) (<a href="https://www.opm.gov/services-for-agencies/hr-line-of-business/multi-agency-policy-advisory-council/department-of-defense-defense-finance-and-accounting-service-dfas/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OPM, 2025</a>, 3). While it is managed by OPM, the end of OPM’s procurement function means the approach to the system is likely to undergo a significant change, thus we will skip this analysis due to this paper’s focus on systems that do not connect to defense or national security systems.

            <h3>Combined Federal Campaign Online Application and Donation System</h3>
            <p>
              The Combined Federal Campaign (“CFC”) Online Application and Donation System, which “centralizes all aspects of CFC administration to a single point of entry for charities, donors, and payee systems” is one system maintained by OPM (<a href="https://www.opm.gov/information-management/privacy-policy/privacy-policy/cfc-pia.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OPM CFC PIA, 2019</a>). Within the PIA, there are no industry solutions referenced. Among the relevant awards, there is one brand name with a limited source justification and no standards referenced. The ultimate end users are Federal employees who donate to CFC (<a href="https://kumu.io/oghaffari/high-risk-it-investments#opm-cfc-online-application-and-donation-system" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghaffari-Tabrizi, 2025</a>). The potential benefits of turning this system into an interoperable one go beyond the employees and agencies who use CFC to streamline their charitable giving – it can also benefit the very non-profit organizations, most of whom are resource-starved, as they would be able to use whatever technology stack they could support or afford rather than being forced to fit into decisions made by OPM or others.

            <h2>Small Business Administration</h2>
            <h3>Certify.SBA.gov</h3>
            <p>
              Certify.sba.gov, which allows “small businesses to manage their applications for various contracting support programs,” is one system maintained by the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) (<a href="https://www.sba.gov/document/report-certifysbagov" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SBA Certify PIA, 2023</a>). Within the PIA, there is one industry solution referenced. Among the relevant awards, there is one brand name with no standards referenced. The ultimate end users are contracting officers at GSA and small businesses who want to work with the Federal Government (<a href="https://kumu.io/oghaffari/high-risk-it-investments#sba-certifysbagov" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghaffari-Tabrizi, 2025</a>). As the U.S. Government moves to bring more small businesses – especially those startups with innovative and new technologies – into the federal contractor ecosystem, the system’s interoperability (or lack thereof) will send a stark and explicit message to Main Street and Wall Street about what Administrations will support going forward. Failing to remove the reference to a CSP in this system will be especially important, as not every CSP is created equal in the very tight race among American CSPs to achieve AI leadership for years, meaning both SBA and the U.S. Government are failing to incentivize usage or even interoperability among the other American CSPs (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/google-is-a-leader-in-the-2024-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-cloud-ai-developer-services" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gokturk, 2024</a>). Making sure anything SBA presents to the small business community, not just Certify.SBA.gov, is interoperable will be the best and fastest way to convert what is currently a five-way race between China, the EU, Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform into a three-way one between China, the EU, and the United States.

            </p>
            <h1>Findings Worth Addressing</h1>
            <h2>Brands or Bust; Nothing is Equal</h2>
            <p>
              Only three systems did not name a brand in their relevant awards and one of those referenced a brand name in their PIAs. The three without a brand name in their awards were the DOI Accounting Reconciliation Tool (ART), the DOI Law Enforcement Management Information System, and the DOL Unemployment Insurance Reporting System, with the DOL system including a reference to a third-party cloud solution in its PIA. Where brands are referenced, the vast majority involve some form of limited competition, including sole source justifications. Where service providers are given sole source or otherwise limited source justification-based awards, they are often selected specifically for their expertise with one of the brand name solutions or otherwise proprietary technologies baked into the infrastructure of these systems. Similarly, many of these limited source justifications indicate the agency relying on that justification is locked in to that particular brand or partner to some extent.
            </p>
            <h2>References to Standards are Nonexistent</h2>
            <p>
              Unsurprisingly, not a single standard was referenced in a single award or otherwise publicly available connected document. This may be as much an issue with the quality of data in FPDS, but the fact the few limited source justifications did not provide for a standards based way to move off a cloud service is not a data issue but a requirements development issue. Relatedly, there may be references to standards in the actual solicitations themselves, but beyond the fact they are not publicly available to check (e.g., awards issued against Alliant 2), all available documentation suggests the reality would be even more references to brand names instead of standards.
            </p>
            <h2>Network Effect Opportunities Abound</h2>
            <p>
              Even among those systems that are not connected to any other system, the end user tends to be a massive population – every Tribal nation, every national law enforcement agency with even a few international ones included, every Federal employee, etc. Beyond the external reach, internally, they tend to also have massive reach within the agency itself, interacting with a broad swath rather than an office or two within the agency. Similarly, for those systems that involve a collection of connected systems, they tend to touch on large and significant populations within their agencies or externally. Should one of these systems require those who work or connect with it to support interoperability, the ability for that concept to spread would be magnified, especially as many of these systems interface with broad swathes of society, not just entire agencies.
            </p>
            <h1>Recommendations for Implementation</h1>
            <p>
              Avoiding a situation where a “1970s-era Air Force Strategic Automated Command and Control System [remains] in use in 2016” and beyond (<a href="https://www.gao.gov/blog/federal-efforts-update-old-it-are-years-behind-schedule-we-looked-impacts-delays" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GAO, 2025</a>), there are a number of steps to take, ideally in conjunction with one another, detailed below. Each recommendation begins with existing work that can be built on and then moves into a proactive, forward-looking idea that, if implemented, would institute a shift towards interoperability at the associated level. The levels analyzed include the solicitation level, covering individual contracts, agency level, outlining how an entire agency could make the shift, and government-wide, with two specific recommendations focused on the Legislative and Executive branches respectively.
            </p>
            <h2>Solicitation Level</h2>
            <p>
              When it comes to cloud-based solutions, there are a few agencies that have cited standards in their procurements (<a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=086d98de8bb8de9114ea647568b713c2" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GSA, 2025</a>) as well as agencies that have changed their procurement rules (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-29683" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASTP, 2024</a>) recently. Considering how many IT contracts end up templatized (<a href="https://cic.gsa.gov/resources/templates" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GSA, 2025</a>), where these templates choose to guide users towards citing standards instead of brands, a greater number of solicitations are likely to incorporate best practices that achieve interoperability as the rules disseminate (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-00895" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CMS, 2024</a>). Where these examples have shown success in achieving interoperability has not always been necessarily due to citing standards, but rather, mechanisms by which an application programming interface (“API”) can be used to communicate with one or more systems, with APIs ultimately being translators between one standard or protocol to another (<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/application_programming_interface" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NIST, 2025</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
              Certain procurement teams, especially those who work with or are embedded with technology teams (e.g. USDS in EOP or Centers of Excellence in the Technology Transformation Services) should be able to identify and spread solicitation best practices that result in interoperable IT environments. This would create a baseline for other agencies to adopt those interoperable solutions used to develop those best practices. It would also create an opportunity to identify the next set of solutions or standards that would be beneficial to address, whether they exist or not, and how to best do so such that it fits within those existing practices to pre-address any potential change management challenges.
            </p>
            <h2>Agency Level</h2>
            <p>
              A number of the High Impact Service Providers (“HISP”), while not necessarily espousing interoperability as a top priority, end up having to address it to some extent simply because of the number of other systems with which they interact (<a href="https://www.performance.gov/cx/hisps/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"GSA, 2025</a>). Similarly, the 17 high-risk systems identified by GAO interact with a number of other internal, external, and public systems (<a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-107041" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GAO, 2024</a>). Multiple administrations, including the current one, have recognized the importance of “centralized mission support capabilities” in a variety of ways, with most of those efforts revolving around the use of shared services, requiring interoperability by their very nature (<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/M-19-16.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">M-19-16, 2019</a>; <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2021-27380" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exec. Order No. 14058, 2021</a>; <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2025-05197" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exec. Order No. 14240, 2025</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
              Certain agencies, especially those that require multiple systems to share data with other systems, should be able to identify the areas where the use of open standards would provide the greatest benefit to them, their mission, and the aim to create an interoperable IT environment. Where success is found, the Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer (“OFCIO”) could identify particular efforts that are worth scaling across the Federal Government, providing for bottom-up development of standards that can then be adopted via solicitations across individual agencies.

              While there have been previous attempts to achieve a Federal Enterprise Architecture (<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/egov_docs/fea_v2.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OFCIO, 2013</a>), which is essentially a map of the entire Federal Government’s information systems, including how they are configured, integrated, interfaced, operated, and secured (<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/enterprise_architecture" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NIST, 2025</a>), those attempts did not achieve the desired success with the problem blamed on, among other things, “no common and shared understanding” among practitioners about what constitutes enterprise architecture, a series of “compliance activities [that] were futile time wasters,” as well as so many meetings that “it impedes normal IT activities” (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160611170127/http://www.ech-bpm.ch/sites/default/files/articles/why_doesnt_the_federal_enterprise_architecture_work.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaver, 2010</a>). However, the U.S. Government has not (<a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-11-318sp" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GAO, 2011</a>) – and should not – give up on attempting to address these identified issues: companies as large as JPMorgan Chase modernized their legacy systems (<a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/ir/annual-report/2023/ar-ceo-letters" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dimon, 2024</a>) while others like Google have undergone a “rip-and-replace” to address a Chinese hack (leading to the development of zero-trust architecture along the way) (<a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/transparency-in-the-shadowy-world-of-cyberattacks/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walker, 2022</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
              Certain agencies, led by OFCIO, should be able to identify the areas where using open standards provides the greatest benefit to the Federal Government with the aim to create an interoperable IT environment. First, start with a few sets of specific standards that allow a phased approach for implementing standards across the public sector. Next, utilize GSA’s centralized procurement authority and, with the requisite input from the most relevant members of industry, adopt a top-down approach towards developing government-wide IT interoperability. GSA should be in charge of the effort, responsible for using centralized procurement data to ensure contracts use standards instead of brands. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (“CISA”) should work with OFCIO to determine what guidance is required, both for private and public sector, and develop that guidance along with the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (“NCCoE”) in NIST. Where standards are missing, CISA and NIST should work together to develop or point to those under development.

            <h3>Legislative Branch</h3>
            <p>
              The FY 2025 National Defense Authorization Act (“NDAA”) saw references to interoperability in the codification of the SWP and in creating efforts to implement AI focused on defense with our allies and partners (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/5009" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NDAA for FY2025, 2024</a>), among other references to the concept. The FY 2024 NDAA recognized the importance of the “inherent interoperability, commonality, and interchangeability of platforms and information systems operated by the United States and one or more covered nations [in order] to enable effective” operations in contested environments (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/2670" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NDAA for FY2024, 2023</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
              Civilian agencies, led by OMB, should be able to identify the obstacles they are facing to implement the same overarching philosophy of achieving an interoperable IT environment. Using appropriations report language for OMB through the Financial Services and General Government (“FSGG”) subcommittees, agencies could identify their particular issues towards achieving this state, allowing those that are government-wide or agency-specific to be addressed accordingly.
            </p>
            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>
              This Administration – and future ones to an increasing degree – will rely heavily on Federal IT systems to advance their key priorities, including greater efficiencies, increased transparency, and better value for agency users and the citizens they support (<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/president-trump-is-making-government-work-for-you-again/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">White House Staff, 2025</a>). Meeting these demands will require an interoperable IT environment that is vendor-agnostic, allows for data portability, and is based on open standards (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1184/R1/6585272.v1" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lewis, 2012</a>). In the current landscape, standards are ignored while brand names are often mentioned or referenced as a reason for limiting competition in numerous federal IT contracts, including for critical systems (<a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-107114" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GAO, 2024</a>). The result is some federal agencies spent tens of millions more than they would have if they switched vendors (<a href="https://www.gao.gov/docket/b-420119.1" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B-420119.1, 2021</a>). While OMB and the FAR Council have attempted to issue guidance on multiple occasions, it is clear that something is missing to bring this practice to an end (<a href="https://netchoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/NetChoice_Garland_The-Pernicious-Consequences-of-Vendor-Lock.pdf" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garland, 2023</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
              The systems analyzed are only a sample – they were chosen by GAO because they have “serious weaknesses in areas that involve substantial resources and provide critical services to the public” (<a href="https://www.gao.gov/high-risk-list" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GAO, 2025</a>). A cursory review of other PIAs shows additional systems with similar scope and scale but without weaknesses. There are also systems that provide critical services with serious weaknesses but without resources. When analyzed, both of these combinations of circumstances are still likely to result in similar findings. If these procurements, throughout any subset, referenced standards instead of brands, and where the recommendations made are implemented, the cost-savings, innovation- inducing, and competition-based IT systems would arguably perform better than those that are not interoperable. The private sector proved interoperability works with one of the world’s biggest banks and one of the world’s biggest tech companies, showing an enterprise with the scale and resources of the public sector could do the same.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ultimately, if the Federal Government wants to match the best practices adopted by the best of industry, it can break vendor lock-in by incentivizing interoperability in all IT contracts through a mandate to use standards before brand names and educating the acquisition workforce about techniques that will ensure they do so effectively.
