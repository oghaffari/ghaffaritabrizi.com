            <p class="usa-intro">Sample Itineraries I've Shared</p>
            <p>I've taken a few cool trips here and there and every now and then, people ask for where I went and stayed. Here are my favorite trips.</p>
            <h2 id="section-heading-h2">Japan</h2>
            <p>
              This was the first trip I took with my very-soon-to-be wife, and though it wasn't the first time I visited the country, it was the first time I felt like I got to truly enjoy and experience it. Besides the company, which was obviously a big reason for why I enjoyed this trip and would visit the country multiple times again, it was the pacing of the trip and the places we visited that made it so magical. This was the first trip we planned together using Trello and it set the foundation for a very successful process we use to make the absolute most of our time. We went right before the Cherry Blossom season started, but because it was a bit warmer than usual that year, we actually were there right for the start. Also, we ate and drank a lot more than what I mentioned in here since everything was great and the lack of people meant we had opportunities to explore entire menus, but I tried to cover the highlights. So without further ado, here is how I would recommend someone spend their first visit to Japan over the span of two weeks!
            </p>
            <h3>Tokyo</h3>
            <h4>Day 1</h4>
            <p>
              Arrive at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/5Ac6hJza3K2CgcKA7" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haneda Airport (HND)</a> just because it is the most central airport and gets you into hte action faster. If you fly into <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/g22zXbEufV1ASUXYA" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Narita Airport (NRT)</a> instead, considering visiting Kairaku-en (Mito), one of Japan's Three Great Gardens, before taking the trek into the city proper. Our flights got us into Haneda late at night, so there wasn't much we did beyond getting to our hotel.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before moving on to the fun stuff, there are two things that made our trip easy and I consider them to be essential: train tickets and pocket wi-fi. The first is first class tickets on JR Pass, or the <a href="https://www.jrailpass.com/green-pass" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Japan Rail Green Pass</a>. Beyond being sure you get your seat and have a great experience, the level of customer service is unrivaled and worth the extra cost to see it for yourself. The second is a pocket wi-fi. With smart phones today able to make use of hot spots, being able to carry one with yourself wherever you go will make sure you don't get lost and stay in touch with everyone. There are a ton of options, but if you want to use the one I went with, it was <a href="https://www.globaladvancedcomm.com/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Global Advanced Communications</a>, which I chose simply because they had enough of their site in English that I could get through it all. No idea if there's anyone better, so consider doing some extra research on this one.
            </p>
            <h4>Day 2</h4>
            <p>
              We stayed in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Je3QCUMP8J5V8v6G8" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asakusa</a> near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sens%C5%8D-ji" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sensō-ji</a> temple. We spent the first day exploring a bit and stopped for some unagi at <a href="http://www.izuei.co.jp/en/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Izuei</a>, soba and tempura at <a href="http://kyourakutei.com/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kyourakutei</a>, drinks at all the bars around <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/LNm5p6HAXfEKueHe7" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shinjuku</a>.
            </p>
            <h4>Day 3</h4>
            <p>
              We checked out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sens%C5%8D-ji" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sensō-ji</a> temple, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Skytree" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tokyo Skytree</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asahi_Beer_Hall" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asahi Beer Hall</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ry%C5%8Dgoku_Kokugikan" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryōgoku Kokugikan</a> (national Sumo stadium), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Sword_Museum" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Japanese Sword Museum</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihabara" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Akihabara</a> district. There were a few weird food things I wanted to try, like the egg salad sandwich at Lawson's that <a href="https://twitter.com/bourdain/status/397169495506448384?lang=en" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthony Bourdain says is amazing</a> (it was) and KFC chicken (<a href="https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/things-to-do/whats-the-deal-with-kfc-and-christmas-in-japan" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Christmas tradition in Japan</a>). We also got taiyaki at a stall in front of Sensō-ji, clod buckwheat noodles and eel tempura at <a href="https://www.edosoba-hosokawa.jp/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edosoba Hosokawa</a>, fried oysters and drinks at <a href="https://www.kami-ya.co.jp/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Restaurant Kamiya</a>, and tempura at <a href="http://nakasei.biz/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tempura Nakasei</a>.
            </p>
            <h4>Day 4</h4>
            <p>
              We explored a bit of the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ZRGuv9c3e9GE9Wmw9" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yanaka neighborhood</a> before checking out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_National_Museum" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tokyo National Museum</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ueno_Park" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ueno Park</a>, the <a href="https://sankan.kunaicho.go.jp/index.html" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imperial Palace</a>, and the <a href="?https://goo.gl/maps/7hpntAKDN3AMm3Jq9" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ginza neighborhood</a>. Throughout the day, we had an egg sandwich, plum sake, and coffee at <a href="https://kayaba-coffee.com/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kayaba Coffee</a>, fried pork cutlets at <a href="https://ge4y500.gorp.jp/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suzuki</a>, fried shrimp cutlets and red bean and cream buns at a stall in Ueno park, and udon at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/nenotsu/?hl=en" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nenotsu</a>. We had come great cocktails at <a href="https://www.barhighfive.com/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bar High Five</a>, which recommended we check out yakitori, smashed fish and cheese, and yuzu highballs at the standing-room only <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/LFg1udtswiEWguBv8" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marugin</a>, which is where highballs were apparently first created.
            </p>
            <h3>Kyoto</h3>
            <h4>Day 5</h4>
            <p>
              Traveling to Kyoto from Tokyo takes about 3.5 hours. We made it in time to check out the 30th anniversary exhibit from the Emperor and Emperoress at the <a href="https://sankan.kunaicho.go.jp/guide/kyoto.html" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kyoto Imperial Palace</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinkaku-ji" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinkaku-ji</a>, and the <a href="https://www.kyoto-nishiki.or.jp/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nishiki</a> market. We also ate wild board hot pot at <a href="https://hatakaku.gorp.jp/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hatakaku</a>.
            </p>
            <h4>Day 6</h4>
            <p>
              We took in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo_Forest_(Kyoto,_Japan)" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arashiyama Bamboo Grove</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginkaku-ji" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Higashiyama Jishō-ji</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher%27s_Walk" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philosopher's Walk</a>, Shirakawa-minami Dori and Gion Shirakawa (areas around the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/gEs15nDB8tVF4UHy8" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yasaka Shrine</a>), and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurama-dera" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kurama-dera Temple</a>. We had a few snacks at our hotel, which focused on providing local cuisine, matcha tea latte at the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove because the tea in Kyoto is famous and they had a respectable restaurant there, tofu at <a href="http://www.tenryuji.com/shigetsu/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shigetsu</a>, sashimi and local craft beers at <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.beerkomachi.com%2F&h=AT0W6IEd9v2BnJeuAJcwqehpxd5n1LkD_jp1DzUkKNd5sB28ILerI_BuErYsKcV2Rk0JH3zRGOfRuV2gYrlgtsjc9u9PXd4ltdevkmpuifFq5ZZ7jq4HGOZVns1Z6Ddat_80Imk4dvTNT4OFtfHcAA" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beer Komachi</a>, whiskey and sake at <a href="http://www.ksix.jp/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bar K6</a>, and sushi and nigiri at <a href="https://www.chojiro.jp/global/" alt="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chojiro</a>.
